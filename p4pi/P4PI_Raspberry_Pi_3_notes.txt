It's possibole to use a Raspberry PI 3 to run P4PI.
Take into account the following notes:
	1- Raspberry PI3 onboard ethernet has a different name so it needs to be manually set to eth0 to be compatible 
	with other scripts
	
	2- Raspberry PI3 has 1GB RAM only. This limits the amount of memory that is possible to allocate to T4P4S programs.
	
	3- t4p4s.sh script has a weird behaviour on PI3, in that it doesn't read the command line arguments correctly.
	This needs investigation to be solved correctly.
	A possible workaround is to put the variable T4P4S_TRACE to 1
		export T4P4S_TRACE=1
	This will solve the issue.
